# Student-Database-Management-System
A simple database programmed in C

**Student Database Management System**

This project is a command-line-based Student Database Management System written in C. It provides a simple interface to manage student records including adding, viewing, searching, and deleting records.

**Features:**
1. **Add Student Record:** Allows users to input student information, including first name, last name, roll number, class, address, and percentage. Multiple records can be added sequentially, and they are stored in a file named "studentInfo."

2. **View Student Records:** Displays all stored student records with details such as student name, roll number, class, address, and percentage. This feature helps users quickly review the available records.

3. **Search Student:** Allows users to search for a specific student record by providing the roll number. If the student record is found, the details are displayed; otherwise, a message indicating that the record was not found is shown.

4. **Delete Student Record:** Enables users to delete a student record by specifying the roll number. If the record is found, it is deleted from the file, and the remaining records are retained. If the record is not found, a message is displayed.

**Credits:**
This project was inspired by the tutorial provided by CodesGallery on YouTube (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9HHKiwvlH8&ab_channel=CodesGallery). The code was developed and customized to create a functional Student Database Management System.

**Usage:**
1. Run the program, and you'll be presented with a menu of options.
2. Choose an option based on the desired action:
   - Add Student Record
   - View Student Records
   - Search Student
   - Delete Student Record
   - Exit
3. Follow the on-screen prompts to perform the selected action.

Please note that this is a basic implementation and can be further enhanced with error handling, data validation, and additional features to suit specific requirements.
